3. Discuss how you will organise you time for the rest of the project. (200 words)

    Your answer should be based around a Gantt chart or other time organisation process. 
    You can easily make this in a spreadsheet program and export an image 
    or take a screenshot for inclusion here. 
    Any words on the diagram do not count towards the word count.

If you use a Gantt chart should include the total time of the projects in weeks. 
You will also need to divide up the parts of your program 
and submission into activities for allocating time to on the chart.

    Your timescales should include progress to this point as well as afterwards.

    You should discuss how you have decided on the time you have allocated 
    to each activity and why you have allocated these amounts of time.

    You should make reference to your chart to clarify the points you make here.
