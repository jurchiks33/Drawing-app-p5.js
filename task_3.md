3. Discuss how you will organise you time for the rest of the project. (200 words)

    Your answer should be based around a Gantt chart or other time organisation process. 
    You can easily make this in a spreadsheet program and export an image 
    or take a screenshot for inclusion here. 
    Any words on the diagram do not count towards the word count.

If you use a Gantt chart should include the total time of the projects in weeks. 
You will also need to divide up the parts of your program 
and submission into activities for allocating time to on the chart.

    Your timescales should include progress to this point as well as afterwards.

    You should discuss how you have decided on the time you have allocated 
    to each activity and why you have allocated these amounts of time.

    You should make reference to your chart to clarify the points you make here.



Gantt chart timeline is from 1 January to 1st March, which will give me approximate 9 weeks to finish drawing app.

week 1 i will debugg and polish up undo/redo Buttons.
Week 2 will be used to ad dmore shapes into a shape tool.
Week 3. Will start on a theme selection. This one activity could be very difficult
and will take week 4 and 5 to compleate theme selection.
Week 6 and 7 will be used to make random image generation tool, whish will allow to generate
random images in canvas and p5.js is perfect for that. Will implement nothing difficult and time consuming.
Planning to go for a random walk generated from points(3000 points) and random colors.
Week 8. will be used for user testing and feedback.
Week 9. Gonna make final adjustements based on feedback from user testing.

Given timeline allocate time according to difficulty of activity, starting from debugging 
and progressinf towards more complex features like themes and random image generator. Final weeks will be used
for user testing and final adjustements.
