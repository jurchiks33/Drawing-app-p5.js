2. Discuss the progress you have made on your project so far. (400 words)

Your answer should include:

    What design work and research you have done while developing your extensions. 
    You can include diagrams here in support of your answer. 
    This might include but not be limited to: brainstorming, 
    interface designs, code diagrams, and notes on the ideas and code.

You donâ€™t have to include everything you have done up to this point 
but try and be selective and select the best examples of your process.

    How much of the code have you written so far. What do you intend to do next?
