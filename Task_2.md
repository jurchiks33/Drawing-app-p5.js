2. Discuss the progress you have made on your project so far. (400 words)

Your answer should include:

    What design work and research you have done while developing your extensions. 
    You can include diagrams here in support of your answer. 
    This might include but not be limited to: brainstorming, 
    interface designs, code diagrams, and notes on the ideas and code.

You donâ€™t have to include everything you have done up to this point 
but try and be selective and select the best examples of your process.

    How much of the code have you written so far. What do you intend to do next?

For now considerable half part of drawing app is done. The focus of this part has been introducing new tools for users and 
enhance user experience.

Design Work and Research.
    1. User interface design:
            Brainstorming: sessions were focued to identify key features that users expect in a modern drawing app, which
                           included popular drawing app reviewing for inspiration.
            
            Interface design: Attention was given to create an intuative user friendly interface. Sketches and wireframes were developed
                              to visualize tools like shape tool, custom brush and undo/redo functions and also for upcoming tools.
    
    2. Code design and Research:
            Code Diagrams: Diagrams were used to plan the structure of the code and how different code modules will interact
                           with main drawing canvas.
            
            Research on Algorithms: For complex tools like custom brush, shape tool and undo/redo buttons were conducted
                                    research on algorithms behind the tools to get desired effect.

Coding Progress.
    1.Shape Tool:
            Completion: Shape tool is fully functional, allowing users to draw different shapes. Arrays and loops were used for difficult shapes.

            Challenges: Implementing accurate and scalable geometric shapes was challenging , especially for star and pentagon.
    
    2. Custom Brush:
            Completion: Most of the custom brush is compleated, missing some minor thing like fixingh to stop drawing brush when mouse movement is stopped,
                        for now it is keep drawing, making a spray can effect.
            
            Challenges: Achieving a natural brush effect required randomization parameter tuning.

    3. Undo/Redo Manager:
            Completion: Basic functionality using Control+Z/Y is working.
            Challenges: Buttons for undo/redo are not yet functional. Debugging is ongoing to resolve issue.
