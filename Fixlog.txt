4--- Need to fix BUG when switched to mirror tool, and after switched to other tools, scrollbar is disapearing. maybe overlaping, try to move to the top bar.

5--- Themes switch need to be done!(FIXED)

6--- Themes switch is not working. Try to make theme manipulations directly in CSS, instead of themes.js and link it to the theme changing (Partially FIXED, Read below)
     Update. Themes are working, but need to link rest of tools to them. Experimental changes on boxBackgroundColor and headerBackgroundColor are working
     use them as example to fix rest of the tools. (FIXED)
     Buttons are not changing color with themes. console log shows that apply theme to 0 buttons, which means code cant find class button. need to implement in html. (FIXED)

     Things get messy, i need to clean up code. (FIXED)

7--- Themes visuals are broken and cover all screen. Most likely CSS is overwriting themes in theme.js. Need to fix it, most likely use of !important in CSS (Fixed)
