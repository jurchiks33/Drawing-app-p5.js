2--- Need text to display over brush scroller.(FIXED)

3--- Also need to adjust starting brush size, it is not as it is on a brush size scroller. (FIXED)

4--- Need to fix BUG when switched to mirror tool, and after switched to other tools, scrollbar is disapearing. maybe overlaping, try to move to the top bar.

5--- Themes switch need to be done!(FIXED)

6--- Themes switch is not working. Try to make theme manipulations directly in CSS, instead of themes.js and link it to the theme changing

7--- Themes visuals are broken and cover all screen. Most likely CSS is overwriting themes in theme.js. Need to fix it, most likely use of !important in CSS (Fixed)
